# Disclaimer
This training and inference pipeline was developed by NVIDIA. It is based on a segmentation and classification model developed by NVIDIA researchers in conjunction with the NIH. 

# Model Overview
A pre-trained model for volumetric (3D) segmentation of the lung from CT images.

## Workflow
The model is trained using a 3D anisotropic hybrid network [1].

## Data
This model was trained on a global dataset with a large experimental cohort collected from across the globe. The CT volumes of 120 independent subjects are provided by NIH with expertsâ€™ lung region annotations.

- Target: Lung
- Task: Segmentation
- Modality: CT  
- Size: 120 3D volumes (90 Training, 10 Validation, 20 Testing)
- Challenge: Large ranging foreground size

# Training configuration
The training was performed with the following:

- Script: train.sh
- GPU: at least 16GB of GPU memory. 
- Actual Model Input: 224 x 224 x 32
- AMP: True
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 1e-4
- Loss: DiceLoss

## Input
Input: 1 channel CT image with intensity in HU and arbitary spacing

1. Resampling spacing to (0.8, 0.8, 5) mm
2. Clipping intensity to [-1500, 500] HU
3. Converting to channel first
4. Randomly cropping the volume to a fixed size (224, 224, 32)
5. Randomly applying spatial flipping
6. Randomly applying spatial rotation
6. Randomly shifting intensity of the volume

## Output
Output: 2 channels
- Label 0: everything else
- Label 1: lung

# Model Performance
Dice score is used for evaluating the performance of the model. On the test set, the trained model achieved score of ~0.96 for lung.

## Training Performance
Training acc over 1250 epochs.
